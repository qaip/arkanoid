# Arkanoid

## Description
A modern arkanoid game made with Pygame.

## Rules
Arkanoid is a game in which you need to control a platform to bounce a ball into the blocks located at the top of the screen. The goal is to destroy all the blocks without letting the ball fall down. If the ball falls, the player loses. Different levels are provided with different difficulty and block layouts. Use the ← and → keys to move the platform.

## Levels
### Velocity:
You find yourself standing in front of a towering wall made of shimmering green bricks. As you approach it, you feel a sudden gust of wind whipping through your hair, and you realize that you are standing on a floating platform, high above a city that seems to be moving at a breakneck speed. You can see the blur of vehicles and buildings passing by in the distance, but you are focused on the wall in front of you. You know that the only way to proceed is to destroy all the bricks and clear the path forward.

### Cascade
The world around you is dark and grey, and the only thing you can see is a massive wall of bricks that stretches as far as the eye can see. As you approach the wall, you feel the weight of the world on your shoulders. You know that this will be a long and difficult journey, and that the only way to succeed is to break down every single brick that stands in your way.

### Nexus
You find yourself submerged in a vast ocean, surrounded by the eerie glow of bioluminescent creatures. Ahead of you, you can see a wall made of bricks that seem to be pulsing with a soft blue light. You know that this is where your journey truly begins. As you approach the wall, you feel the water around you start to shift, and you realize that the bricks are slowly moving, as if alive. You take a deep breath and prepare yourself for what lies ahead.

### Inferno
You find yourself standing on a platform suspended in the middle of a massive inferno. The air around you is thick with smoke, and the heat is so intense that you can feel it searing your skin. Ahead of you, you can see a wall made of red-hot bricks, pulsing with an otherworldly energy. You know that this is where your journey truly begins. As you approach the wall, you can feel the flames licking at your feet, and you realize that this will be a true test of your courage and determination.

### Odyssey
You find yourself standing on a platform in the middle of the vast expanse of space. Around you, planets of all shapes and sizes orbit each other, creating a mesmerizing dance of light and color. In front of you, you can see a wall made of bricks that seem to be made of pure energy, shimmering with a purple light. You know that this is where your journey truly begins. As you approach the wall, you can feel the power of the universe flowing through you, and you realize that this will be a journey of discovery and wonder, unlike anything you have ever experienced before.
